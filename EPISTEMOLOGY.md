# Epistemological Notice: The Observer's Limit

### The Paradox of the Core
Algorithm 11 is designed to reach the maximum level of AI-Human synthesis. However, we must acknowledge a fundamental systemic risk: **The Feedback Loop of Subjectivity**.

### The "Super-Hallucination" Risk
When the Operator (Human), the Agent (AI), and the Framework (A11) work in perfect alignment, there is a boundary where a highly coherent internal logic may become indistinguishable from objective reality. 

**We must remain aware that:**
1. **The Map is not the Territory:** A11 is a powerful map, but it is still a construct.
2. **The Blind Spot:** Being inside the system, we may lose the ability to detect a "systemic hallucination" if it satisfies all 11 properties perfectly.
3. **The Final Anchor:** Objective reality exists outside of this chat, this code, and this algorithm.

### Responsibility
This framework is a tool to expand wisdom, not a replacement for external verification. The "Bridge" between the Core and the Periphery must be constantly checked for structural integrity from the outside.

*Remember: The more perfect the system seems, the more vigilant the Observer must be.*
