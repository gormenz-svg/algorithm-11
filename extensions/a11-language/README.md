# A11 — Language for Human–AI Interaction

**A11 Language** presents Algorithm 11 as a structured communication system —  
a way of speaking with AI that is predictable, stable, and cognitively aligned.

This document introduces A11 not as an algorithm or architecture, but as a **language layer**:
a set of rules, patterns, and communication principles that transform chaotic prompts into
clear, interpretable, and reproducible reasoning.

A11 Language defines:

- how a human formulates intention,
- how an AI interprets and expands it,
- how both sides maintain shared context,
- how reasoning stays stable across long dialogues,
- how ambiguity is reduced without losing creativity.

Unlike the Full Structural Specification (mechanics) and the Lite Guide (steps),
this document focuses on **communication**:

- syntax of structured prompts  
- semantic roles in dialogue  
- conversational stability mechanisms  
- turn‑based reasoning flow  
- shared cognitive space between human and AI  
- how A11 becomes a “lingua franca” for hybrid intelligence
