# A11 — Cognitive Architecture

**A11 as a Cognitive Architecture** presents Algorithm 11 not as a protocol or a set of steps, but as a complete cognitive system that defines how hybrid human–AI reasoning is structured, stabilized, and scaled.

This document introduces A11 as:

- a multi‑layered cognitive model,
- a system of roles and functions,
- a mechanism for stable reasoning,
- a framework for hybrid intelligence,
- a meta‑architecture that governs how thinking happens.

Unlike the Full Structural Specification, which focuses on the internal mechanics of A11, the Cognitive Architecture document explains:

- how A11 organizes cognition,
- how it separates intention from computation,
- how it creates a stable reasoning environment,
- how it scales from micro‑tasks to macro‑systems,
- how it integrates human and AI agents into one cognitive loop.
