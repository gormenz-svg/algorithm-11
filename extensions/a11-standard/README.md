# A11 — Standard for Human–AI Interaction  
**A11‑STD: A Structured Standard for Hybrid Reasoning**

This document defines **A11‑STD**, the formal standard for structured interaction  
between humans and AI systems.  
It establishes clear rules, expectations, and quality criteria for hybrid reasoning.

While the Full Structural Specification describes the internal mechanics of A11,  
and the Cognitive Architecture and OS Thinking documents describe cognition and processes,  
**A11‑STD focuses on norms, requirements, and guarantees**:

- how a human and an AI should interact,  
- what constitutes a valid reasoning process,  
- how to ensure transparency and reproducibility,  
- how to maintain stability and avoid reasoning failures,  
- how to evaluate the quality of hybrid decision‑making.

A11‑STD is not a protocol or a guide —  
it is a **formal standard** that defines what “correct” interaction looks like  
in systems where humans and AI collaborate.

## What A11‑STD Provides
- definitions and terminology  
- interaction requirements  
- quality and safety criteria  
- reproducibility standards  
- transparency and traceability rules  
- evaluation metrics for reasoning  
- compliance levels (A11‑STD‑L1, L2, L3)  
- guidelines for multi‑agent environments
