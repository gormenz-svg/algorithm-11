# A11 — Core Standard Documents

This directory contains the core documents of **Algorithm 11 (A11)** — a universal deterministic reasoning architecture designed for autonomous systems, robotics, hybrid human–AI reasoning, and intelligent infrastructure.

These documents define the canonical structure, cognitive model, decision layer, language system, and engineering integration patterns of A11.

## 📘 Core Documents

### **A11 — Structural Architecture Specification**
The canonical, formal, and complete definition of the A11 architecture.  
Includes the 12‑stage geometry, operators, transitions, recursion model, invariants, mathematical guarantees, diagrams, and compliance requirements.  
This is the authoritative reference for all A11‑based systems.

### **A11 — Overview**
A high‑level introduction to the purpose, principles, and structure of A11.  
Explains how the core documents relate to each other and how A11 fits into the autonomy stack.

### **A11 — Cognitive Architecture Specification**
Defines A11 as a cognitive system: roles, layers, functions, stability mechanisms, and the hybrid reasoning loop.  
Focuses on the cognitive model rather than the internal mechanics.

### **A11 — Decision Layer Specification**
Formalizes A11 as a deterministic, interpretable decision‑making layer between perception and control.  
Defines interfaces, operational cycle, safety guarantees, and integration requirements.

### **A11 — Language Specification**
Defines the A11 Language — a structured communication and intent‑formalization system for hybrid human–AI reasoning.  
Includes syntax, semantics, message types, frames, and interaction patterns.

### **A11 — System Integration Guide**
Engineering guide for integrating A11 into autonomous systems, robotic platforms, multi‑agent architectures, and hybrid reasoning systems.  
Describes interfaces, deployment patterns, and real‑world integration considerations.

## 📂 Purpose of the Core Folder

The **core** directory contains only the foundational documents that define the A11 standard:

- canonical architecture  
- cognitive model  
- decision layer  
- language  
- system integration  
- overview  

Applied domain documents (autonomous vehicles, robotics, off‑Earth construction, etc.) are stored separately.

## 📄 Versioning

All documents follow semantic versioning:

- **v1.x** — stable, canonical versions  
- **v2.x** — future extended architecture  
- **Draft** — experimental or in‑progress documents
