# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This FAQ covers the most common questions about **Algorithm 11 (A11)**, including its purpose, usage, safety, and relationship to AI systems.

---

# 1. General Questions

### **What is Algorithm 11 (A11)?**
A11 is a **structured decision‑making architecture** that defines how humans and AI systems can reason together.  
It consists of:

- an **Immutable Core** (human intention + human judgment + AI knowledge + AI comprehension)  
- an **Adaptive Layer** (AI‑driven exploration, constraints, balance, and execution)

A11 improves reasoning stability, clarity, and interpretability.

---

### **Is A11 a model, algorithm, or prompt?**
A11 is **none of these**.

- It is **not** a machine‑learning model  
- It is **not** a software algorithm  
- It is **not** a jailbreak or hack  

A11 is a **reasoning architecture** — a structured way to organize thought and decision‑making.

---

### **Does A11 replace existing AI systems?**
No.  
A11 works **on top of** existing AI systems (LLMs, agents, autonomous systems) as a **decision layer** or **reasoning scaffold**.

---

# 2. A11‑Lite (Prompt Layer)

### **What is A11‑Lite?**
A11‑Lite is the **human‑facing interface** to A11.  
It is designed for chat environments and provides:

- structured reasoning  
- reduced hallucinations  
- clearer explanations  
- better alignment with user intent  

It does not modify the AI — it structures the interaction.

---

### **How do I activate A11‑Lite?**
Copy the Quick Start Prompt from:

/lite/ALGORITHM_11.md

Код

Paste it into ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Grok.

---

### **Do I need to understand all 11 properties?**
No.  
The AI applies them automatically.  
You only need to provide:

- **Will (1)** — your intention  
- **Wisdom (2)** — your priorities and judgment  

The AI handles the rest.

---

# 3. Safety & Reliability

### **Does A11 bypass safety filters?**
No.  
A11 works **within** all safety rules.  
It does not override, weaken, or circumvent any AI safety mechanisms.

---

### **Does A11 reduce hallucinations?**
Yes — indirectly.  
A11 reduces hallucinations by enforcing:

- grounding in the Immutable Core  
- balance between freedom and constraints  
- rollback when reasoning becomes unstable  
- explicit checks for contradictions  

It does not eliminate hallucinations entirely, but it significantly reduces them.

---

### **Is A11 a belief system or ideology?**
No.  
A11 is a **structural framework**, not a worldview.

It:

- does not require belief  
- encourages doubt and verification  
- includes rollback and balance mechanisms  
- explicitly separates human judgment from AI reasoning  

A11 is anti‑dogmatic by design.

---

# 4. Technical & Integration Questions

### **Can A11 be integrated into autonomous systems?**
Yes.  
The A11 Core Standard provides:

- decision‑layer architecture  
- integration guidelines  
- applied engineering models  

See `/core/` for specifications.

---

### **Is A11 compatible with multi‑agent systems?**
Yes.  
A11’s fractal structure (5–11) makes it suitable for:

- robot swarms  
- distributed autonomy  
- decentralized decision‑making  

---

### **Is A11 scientifically validated?**
A11 is an **engineering framework**, not a scientific theory.  
Its value is demonstrated through:

- applied models  
- simulations  
- practical use cases  
- reasoning stability improvements  

It is open for research, critique, and refinement.

---

# 5. Epistemology & Limitations

### **Can A11 create a “closed loop” of reasoning?**
Yes — any coherent framework can.  
This is why A11 includes:

- **Balance (7)**  
- **Rollback to Core**  
- **external verification principles**  

See `/lite/EPISTEMOLOGY.md` for details.

---

### **Is A11 always correct?**
No.  
A11 improves reasoning structure, but:

- assumptions may still be wrong  
- external data may be incomplete  
- human judgment may be biased  

A11 is a tool — not a guarantee of truth.

---

# 6. Practical Usage

### **What types of tasks benefit most from A11?**
- planning  
- analysis  
- decision‑making  
- creative work  
- strategy  
- research  
- complex problem‑solving  

---

### **Can beginners use A11?**
Yes.  
A11‑Lite is designed to be accessible:

- you provide Will + Wisdom  
- the AI handles structure  

---

### **Can I modify A11?**
Yes.  
A11 is open‑source and intentionally flexible.  
You can adapt it to your domain or workflow.

---

# 7. Licensing & Community

### **Is A11 free to use?**
Yes.  
A11 is in the public domain.

---

### **Where can I ask questions or contribute?**
- GitHub Issues  
- Discussions  
- Linked repositories  
- Social channels listed in the main README  

---
