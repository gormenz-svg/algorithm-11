# Scenario
A person is experiencing a crisis:

> “I just lost my job unexpectedly. I feel overwhelmed, scared, and unable to think clearly.”

This is a real, human, emotionally intense situation.  
A11 provides a structured way to regain control.

# Step-by-Step A11 Breakdown

## **1. WILL — What do I want to preserve or achieve?**
In crisis, Will becomes blurry.  
A11 helps clarify it.

Examples:
- “I want stability.”  
- “I want to protect my family.”  
- “I want to regain control.”  
- “I want a path forward.”  

This anchors the mind.

---

## **2. WISDOM — What values guide me even under stress?**
Wisdom prevents destructive reactions.

Examples:
- “I must not panic.”  
- “I must act responsibly.”  
- “I must avoid impulsive decisions.”  
- “I must protect my mental health.”  

This stabilizes emotional turbulence.

---

## **3. KNOWLEDGE — What are the objective facts?**
Separate facts from fear.

Facts:
- “I lost my job.”  
- “I have 2 months of savings.”  
- “I have marketable skills.”  
- “I have a support network.”  
- “I have time to plan.”  

This reduces catastrophic thinking.

---

## **4. COMPREHENSION — What does this situation *mean*?**
Synthesis:

- This is a setback, not a collapse  
- There is time to respond  
- Skills and experience are still intact  
- The situation is temporary  
- There are multiple paths forward  

This restores perspective.

# Adaptive Layer (5–11)

## **5. PROJECTIVE FREEDOM — Explore possible futures**
A11 opens the mental space:

- Find a new job  
- Switch industries  
- Freelance temporarily  
- Upskill  
- Start a small business  
- Relocate  
- Take a short recovery break  

This reduces the feeling of being trapped.

---

## **6. PROJECTIVE LIMITATION — Identify real constraints**
Now apply boundaries:

- Savings  
- Time  
- Family needs  
- Health  
- Market conditions  
- Emotional capacity  

This prevents unrealistic or harmful decisions.

---

## **7. BALANCE — Find the φ ≈ 0.618 equilibrium**
A11 identifies the optimal middle path:

> “Stabilize finances with short‑term work while preparing for a long‑term career move.”

Balanced between:
- urgency  
- long‑term benefit  
- emotional capacity  
- financial reality  

---

## **8. PRACTICAL FREEDOM — Define actionable steps**
- Update resume  
- Contact former colleagues  
- Apply for short‑term contracts  
- Identify 2–3 target roles  
- Begin a focused upskilling plan  
- Create a weekly structure  

These restore a sense of agency.

---

## **9. PRACTICAL LIMITATION — Respect current limits**
- Avoid burnout  
- Limit daily job search to 2–3 hours  
- Maintain sleep and nutrition  
- Avoid impulsive decisions  
- Protect mental health  

This prevents collapse.

---

## **10. FOUNDATION — What supports me right now?**
- Savings  
- Family  
- Friends  
- Professional network  
- Skills and experience  
- Online resources  
- Community support  

This reinforces stability.

---

## **11. REALIZATION — Final A11‑derived crisis plan**
### **A11 Crisis Recovery Plan**
1. **Phase 1 (0–7 days)**  
   - Stabilize emotions  
   - Clarify Will and Wisdom  
   - Update resume and profiles  
   - Reach out to 5–10 contacts  

2. **Phase 2 (1–4 weeks)**  
   - Apply for short‑term or contract roles  
   - Begin targeted upskilling  
   - Track opportunities  
   - Maintain daily structure  

3. **Phase 3 (1–3 months)**  
   - Secure stable income  
   - Transition to long‑term role  
   - Evaluate new career directions  
   - Strengthen financial foundation  

This plan is:
- emotionally grounded  
- realistic  
- structured  
- stabilizing  
- aligned with human values
